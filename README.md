## Overview

In this hands-on workshop, we'll learn how to build custom maps & visualizations using open data and free, open-source, offline-ready tools from Mapbox. Through hands-on activities, we will cover basic Mapbox concepts and tools, including:
- Editing & styling maps in Mapbox Atlas, an offline map data & design tool
- Developing map visualizations with Kepler, a powerful and easy to use open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets

### Goals

By completing this workshop you'll learn how to...

- Create & publish a new style in Studio from a template
- Add a new layer with a custom tileset source to a style in Studio
- Build two different custom visualizations in Kepler

### Prerequisites

Some familiarity with working geographic data is helpful, but not required. No experience with web mapping is required. But everyone is welcome.

This workshop would not have been possible without the hard work I borrowed from Anjana Vakil, my excellent co-presenters Coleman McCormick from Fulcrum, and John Crowley from NetHope. Thanks NetHope Summit for creating this space for us to build together.
